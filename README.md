# Password-Generator

The intent of this project was to create a random password generator for an employee who may be dealing with very sensitive data. The generator is to give the user the option to input password length between 8 and 128 characters with the user's choice to include letters (both upper and lower case), numbers, and special characters.

Instructions - The process is initiated by the user clicking a "Generate Password" button. Once the user inputting a valid choice of password length of between 8 and 128 characters, they are given the following series of confirm options:

- Do you want your password to contain numbers?
- Do you want your password to contain special characters?
- Do you want your password to contain Upper Case letters?
- Do you want your password to contain Lower Case letters?

Once all of the criteria has been selected, a randomly generated password will appear in the text area.
